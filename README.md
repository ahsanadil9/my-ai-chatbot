# Chatbot Program with Llama 4 & Groq

Welcome to the **Chatbot Program**! This project demonstrates an AI-powered chatbot that uses the **Llama 4** model for conversation and **Groq** for interacting with AI. The chatbot is built using JavaScript, and it allows users to chat interactively in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can chat with the AI model and receive real-time responses.
- **Streamed Responses**: The bot streams responses as it generates them, providing a more dynamic user experience.
- **Chat History**: The chatbot remembers previous interactions, making conversations more meaningful.
- **Exit Command**: Type 'exit' anytime to end the conversation.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling for smooth user experience.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed to run this application.
- **API Key**: You'll need an API key for Groq and the Llama 4 model.

### Dependencies:
- `groq-sdk`: For interacting with the Groq API.
- `readline-sync`: For handling user input.
- `colors`: For adding colored text to the console.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.

## How It Works

The chatbot uses the **Llama 4 model** to generate responses to user input. It interacts with the model in a streaming manner, meaning that the response is sent in chunks as itâ€™s being generated.

1. **User Input**: The user enters their message through the command line interface.
2. **AI Model Interaction**: The message is sent to the Groq API, which processes it using the Llama 4 model.
3. **Streamed Response**: The bot streams the response back to the user, showing the content in real-time.
4. **Chat History**: The chat history is stored and used to make the conversation more meaningful.
